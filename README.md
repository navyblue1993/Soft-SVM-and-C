# Soft-SVM-and-C

It is a study on C value's impact if the data is linear seperatable.

The experiments in executed on the python script created by Peter Prettenhoer. Since the license issue, I cannot share the code here.

The conclusion is that if the data is linear seperable and we set C as 0(or really small), then our ojective function become minimizing the w and the marginal constraint for hard SVM is borken.
